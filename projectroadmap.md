# 🐾 PetPoint: Project Roadmap  

# Overview  
**PetPoint** is a simple pet grooming appointment tracker built with **Python** and tested in **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
It helps pet groomers manage their daily appointments by allowing them to add, view, and search bookings digitally — reducing scheduling mistakes and saving time.

- [x] Explore existing Python scheduling and management systems  
- [x] Review:[PetScheduler (GitHub)](https://github.com/ksu-is/PetScheduler)  
- [ ] Study Python CSV and SQLite libraries for saving data  
- [ ] Research how to use Jupyter Notebooks for testing project logic  
- [ ] Look into using `datetime` and `tkinter` for scheduling and GUI features
