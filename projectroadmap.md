# 🐾 PetPoint: Project Roadmap  

# Overview  
**PetPoint** is a simple pet grooming appointment tracker built with **Python** and tested in **Jupyter Notebooks**.  
It helps pet groomers manage their daily appointments by allowing them to add, view, and search bookings digitally — reducing scheduling mistakes and saving time.

## 🔍 Research  
- [x] Explore existing Python scheduling and management systems  
- [x] Review:[PetScheduler (GitHub)](https://github.com/ksu-is/PetScheduler)  
- [ ] Study Python CSV and SQLite libraries for saving data  
- [ ] Research how to use Jupyter Notebooks for testing project logic  
- [ ] Look into using `datetime` and `tkinter` for scheduling and GUI features  

---

## 🧩 Features (Planned for PetPoint)  
- [x] Create function to add new grooming appointments  
- [x] Create function to view all appointments  
- [ ] Add search feature (by pet name or owner name)  
- [ ] Allow editing and deleting appointments  
- [ ] Store appointment data using CSV or SQLite  
- [ ] Include details: pet’s name, owner info, service type, date/time  
- [ ] Build a simple command-line or Tkinter-based interface  
- [ ] Make it easy to run in **Python (.py)** or **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**  

---

# Sprint 1 Goals  
- [x] Create GitHub repository for PetPoint  
- [x] Evaluate similar GitHub projects for reference  
- [x] Write initial Python script to add appointments  
- [ ] Test appointment-adding function in Jupyter Notebook  
- [ ] Document setup and code flow in the README.md
